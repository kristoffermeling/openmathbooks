\section{\omgr}
\textbf{Point}\os
A given position is called a\footnote{See also \refsec{Koord}.} \textit{point}\index{point}. We mark a point by drawing a dot, which we preferably name by a letter. Below we have drawn the points $ A $ and $ B $.
\fig{punkt1}
\textbf{Line and segment}\os
A straight dash with infinite length (!) is called a \textit{line}\index{line}. The fact that a line has infinite length, makes \textsl{drawing} a line impossible, we can only \textsl{imagine} a line. Imagining a line can be done by drawing a straight dash and think of its ends as wandering out in each direction.
\fig{linj1}
A straight dash between two points is called a \textit{segment}\index{segment}.
\fig{linjstk1}
We write the segment between the points $ A $ and $ B $ as $ AB $.  \vsk
\info{Notice}{
A segment is a part of a line, therefore a line and a segment have a lot of attributes in common. When writing about lines, it will be up to the reader to confirm whether the same applies for segments. Hence we avoid the need of writing ''lines/segments''.
}

\newpage
\info{Segment or length?}{ 
\fig{linjstk3}
The segments $ AB $ and $ CD $ have equal length, but they are not the same segment. Still we'll write $ {AB=CD} $. That is, we'll use the same names for the line segments and their lengths (the same applies for angles and their values, see page \pageref{vinklar}\,-\,\pageref{vinkelend}). We'll do this by the following reasons:
\begin{itemize}
\item The context will make it clear weather we are talking about a segment or a length.
\item Finding it necessary to write e.g. ''the length of $ AB $'' would make sentences less readable.
\end{itemize}
}
\newpage
\textbf{Distance}\os
There are infinite ways one can move from one point to another and some ways will be longer than others. When talking about a distance in geometry, we usually mean the \textsl{shortest} distance. For geometries studied in this book the shortest distance between two points will always equal the length of the segment (blue in the below figure) connecting them.
\fig{linjstk2}
\textbf{Circle; center, radius and diameter} \os
If we make an enclosed curve where all points on this curve have the same distance to a given point, we have a \textit{circle}\index{circle}. The point which all the points on the curve have an equal distance to is the \textit{center}\index{circle!center} of the circle. A segment between a point on the curve and the center is called a \textit{radius}\index{radius}. A segment between two points on the curve, passing through the circle center, is called a \textit{diameter}\index{diameter}\footnote{As mentioned, \textit{radius} and \textit{diameter} can just as well indicate the length of the segments.}.
\fig{sirk1_eng}
\textbf{Arcs and sectors} \os
A part of a circular curve is called an \textit{arc}\index{arc}. The shape formed by an arc and two associated radii is called a \textit{sector}\index{sector}. The below figure shows three different sectors.
\fig{sirk3}
\newpage
\textbf{Parallel lines}\os
Lines aligned in the same direction are \textit{parallel}\index{parallel}. The below figure shows two pairs of parallel lines.
\fig{parl1}
We use the symbol \sym{$ \parallel $} to indicate that two lines are parallel.
\[ AB\parallel CD \]
\fig{parl1a}
\textbf{Angles} \label{vinklar}\os
Non-parallel lines will sooner or later intersect. The gap formed  by two non-parallel lines is called an \textit{angle}\index{angle}. We draw angles as small circular curves:
\fig{vink1}
Lines creating an angle are called the \textit{sides}\index{angle!side} of the angle. The intersection point of the lines are called the  \textit{vertex}\index{angle!vertex} of the angle. It is common to use the symbol \sym{$ \angle $} to underline the angle in question. In the below figure we have the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item the angle $ \angle BOA $  has angle sides $ OB $ and $ OA $ and vertex $ O $.
\item the angle $ \angle AOD $  has angle sides $ OA $ and $ OD $ and vertex $ O $.	
\end{itemize}
\fig{vink2}
\newpage
\textbf{Measure of angles in degrees}\os
When measuring an angle in degrees, we imagine a circular curve divided into 360 equally long pieces. We call one such piece 1 \textit{degree}\index{degree}, indicated by the symbol \sym{$ ^\circ $}. 
\fig{vink3} \vsk
Notice that an angle with measure $ 90^\circ $ is indicated by the symbol \sym{$ \square $}. Such an angle is called a \textit{right}\index{angle!right} angle. Lines which form right angles are said to be \textit{perpendicular}\index{segment!perpendicular} to one another, indicated by the symbol $ \sym{$ \perp $} $.
\[ AB\perp CD \]
\fig{vink3a}
\newpage
\info{What angle?}{
	Strictly speaking, when two segments (or lines) intersect, they form two angles; the one larger than $ 180^\circ $ and the other smaller than $ 180^\circ $. Usually it is the smaller angle we wish to study, therefore it is common to define $ \angle AOB $ as the \textsl{smaller} angle formed by the segments $ OA $ and $ OB $.
	\fig{vink2a}
	As long as there are only two segments/lines present, it is\\ common using only one letter to indicate the angle:
	\fig{vink2b}
}\vsk
\label{vinkelend}
\newpage
\reg[\topv \label{toppv}]{
	Two opposite angles with a common vertex is called \textit{vertical angles}\index{angle!vertical}. Vertical angles are of equal measure.
	\fig{vink4a}
}
\fork{\ref{toppv} \topv}{\vspace{-10pt}
	\fig{vink4aa}
	We have
	\algv{
		\angle BOC+\angle DOB=180^\circ	\\[5pt]
		\angle AOD+\angle DOB=180^\circ
	}	
	Hence, $ {\angle BOC = \angle AOD} $. Similarly, $ {\angle COA=\angle DOB} $.

	Vinklar med parvis parallelle høgre og venstre vinkelbein er like store.

\end{comment}
\newpage
\textbf{Sides and vertices} \os
When line segments form an enclosed shape, they form a \textit{polygon}\index{polygon}. The below figure shows, from left to right, a triangle\index{triangle} (3-gon), a quadrilateral\index{quadrilateral} (4-gon) and a pentagon (5-gon).
\fig{kant1}
The segments of a polygon are called \textit{edges}\index{edge} or \textit{sides}\index{side!of polygon}. The respective intersection points of the segments are the \textit{vertices}\index{polygon!vertices of} of the polygon. That is, the triangle below has vertices $ A $, $ B $ and $ C $ and sides (edges) $ AB $, $ BC $ and $ AC $.
\fig{kant2}
\info{\note}{
Often we'll write a letter only to indicate a vertex of a polygon.
\fig{kant2b}
} \vsk

\textbf{Diagonals} \os
Segments between two vertices not belonging to the same side of a polygon is called a \textit{diagonal}. The below figure shows the diagonals $ AC $ and $ BD $.
\fig{kant7_eng}
\newpage
\subsubsection{Altitudes and base lines}
In \refsec{Areal}, the terms \textit{base}\index{base} and \textit{height}\index{height} (\textit{altitude}\index{altitude}) play an important role. To find the height of a triangle, we choose one of the sides to be the base. In the below figure, let's start with $ AB $ as the base. Then the height is the segment from $ AB $  (potentially, as is the case here, the extension of $ AB $) to $ C $, perpendicular to $ AB $.
\fig{tri15_eng}
Since there are three sides which can be bases, a triangle has three heights.
\fig{tri15b_eng}
\info{Notice}{The terms altitude and base also applies to other polygons.}
\section{\eignsk}
In addition to having a certain number of sides and vertices, polygons have other attributes, such as sides or angles of equal measure, or parallel sides. There are specific names of polygons with special attributes, and these names can be put into an overview where some ''inherit''\footnote{In \rref{trekantar} and \rref{firkantar} this is indicated by arrows.} attributes from others.\regv

\newpage
\subsubsection{\artri \label{artri}}
Concerning triangles, there are three different cases to study: \vsk

\textit{1) The baseline and the altitude have a common end point} \os
Let's find the area of a right triangle with baseline $ 5 $ and altitude $ 3 $.
\fig{tri16}
We can make a rectangle by copying our triangle and joining the \\hypotenuses:
\fig{tri17}
By \rref{arfir}, the area of the rectangle equals $ {5\cdot 3} $. The area of one of the triangles makes up half the area of the rectangle, so
\[ \text{The area of the blue triangle} = \frac{5\cdot 3}{2} \]
Regarding the blue triangle we have
\[\frac{5\cdot3}{2}= \frac{\text{baseline}\cdot \text{height}}{2} \]
\newpage
\textit{2) The altitude is placed inside the triangle, but have no common end point with the baseline} \os
The below triangle has baseline 5 and altitude 4.
\fig{tri20}
We make a rectangle containing the blue triangle (split into the red triangle and the yellow triangle):
\fig{tri20a}
Observe that
\begin{itemize}
	\item the area of the red triangle makes up half the area of the rectangle formed by the red and the yellow triangle.
	\item the area of the yellow triangle makes up half the area of the rectangle formed by the yellow and the green triangle.
\end{itemize}
It now follows that the sum of the areas of the yellow triangle and the red triangle makes up half the area of the rectangle formed by the four colored triangles. The area of this rectangle equals $ 5\cdot4 $, and since our original triangle (the blue) includes the red triangle and the orange triangle, we have
\[ \text{The area of the blue triangle}=\frac{5\cdot4}{2}=\frac{\text{baseline}\cdot\text{height}}{2} \] 
\newpage
\textit{2) The altitude is placed outside the triangle} \os
The below triangle has baseline 4 and altitude 3. 
\fig{tri18}
We now make a rectangle containing the blue triangle:
\fig{tri18a}
Now we introduce the following names:
\alg{
	\text{The area of the rectangle}= R \\	\text{The area of the blue triangle} = B\\
	\text{The area of the orange triangle} = O \\  \text{The area of the green triangle} = G
}
We have
\alg{
	R&= 3\cdot10=30\vn
	O&= \frac{3\cdot10}{2}=15\vn
	G &= \frac{3\cdot 6}{2}=9
}
Moreover,
\algv{
	B &=R-O-G \\
	&=30-15-9\\
	&=6
}
Observe that we can write
\[ 6=\frac{4\cdot3}{2} \]
Regarding the blue triangle we recognize this as 
\[ \frac{4\cdot3}{2}=\frac{\text{base}\cdot\text{height}}{2} \]
\newpage
\textit{The three cases summarized}\os
For a chosen baseline in a triangle, one of the cases discussed will always be valid. All cases resulted in the same expression for the area of the triangle.\regv

\section{Tredimensjonal geometri}
So far, we have studied two-dimensional shapes as triangles, quadrilaterals, circles etc. Every two-dimensinal figure can be drawn in a coordinate system with two axes.
\fig{3da}
In order to draw \outl{three-dimensional} shapes however, we need three axes:
\fig{3db}
While we have used the phrase \textit{width}/\textit{length} and \textit{height} to describe a rectangle, we say that the box above has a width, a height \textsl{and} a length (depth). \vsk

The area lying on the ''outside'' of a three-dimensional shape is called the \outl{surface}. The surface of the box above is made up by 6 rectangles. Polygons that are parts of a surface are called \outl{lateral surfaces}.

\section{Volum}
When we speak of how much space there is inside an object, we speak of it's \outl{volume}. As a measure of volume, we imagine a cube with sides of length 1.
\fig{vol1}
We shall call such a cube a 'unit cube'. Say we have a rectangular prism with width 3, length 4 and height 2.
\fig{vol2}
Inside it, there is room for exactly 24 unit cubes.
\fig{vol2a}
Other than simply counting unit cubes, we can find this by calculating
\[ 3\cdot 4\cdot 2=24\]
\reg[The volume of a rectangular prism I]{
	\fig{vol2c_eng}
	\[\text{volume}=\text{width}\cdot\text{length}\cdot\text{height} \]
}
\newpage
\subsubsection{Base area}
To calculate the volume of elementary shapes, it is useful to apply the term \outl{base surface}\index{base surface}. Inthe same way as with baselines\footnote{See page \pageref{grunnlinje}.}, it is our choice of base surface that decides what the height is. Regarding the prism on the preceding page, it is natural to choose the horizontally aligned surface as the base. To indicate the base we shall use the letter $ G $:
\fig{vol2b}
The base surface has area $ 3\cdot4=12 $, and the corresponding height is 2. The volume of the prism equals the base surface area multiplied by the height:
\alg{
	V &= \colb{3\cdot 4} \cdot 2 \\
	&= \colb{G}\cdot 2\\
	&= 24
}
\reg[Volumee of a rectangular prism II]{
	\fig{vol2d}
	\[ \text{volume}=G\cdot \text{height} \]
}
\info{Grunnflata eller grunnflatearealet?}{
	In the above text, we first let $ G $ denote the base surface, and later we let $ G $ denote the \textsl{base surface area}. In this book the term \textit{base surface} is so strongly connected to the \textsl{base surface area} that we will let the same symbol denote them both, leaving the reader to differ them from the context of use.
