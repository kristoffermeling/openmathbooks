\subsection*{Addition with amounts}
When we have an amount and wish to add more, we use the symbol \sym{$ + $}. If we have 2 and want to add 3, we write
\[ 2+3=5 \]
\fig{plusm1}
The order in which we add have no impact on the results; starting off with 2 and adding 3 is the same as starting off with 3 and adding 2:
\[ 3+2=5 \]

	Common ways of saying $ 2+3 $ include

\sym{+} brings the possibility of expressing numbers in different ways, for example is $ {5=2+3} $ and $ {5=1+4} $. In this context, \sym{=} means ''has the same value as''. This is also the case regarding subtraction, multiplication and division which we'll look at in the next three sections.

\subsection*{Subtraction with amounts}
When removing a part of an amount, we use the symbol \sym{$ - $}:
\[ 5-{\color{red} 3}=2 \]

	A calculation involving subtraction includes one or more \textit{terms}\index{term} and one \textit{difference}\index{difference}. In the calculation

	Common ways of saying $ 5-3 $ include
	\begin{itemize}
		\item ''5 minus 3'' \\
		\item ''3 subtracted from 5''
	\end{itemize}
} \vsk \vsk

\info{A new interpretation of 0}{
	As mentioned earlier in this book, 0 can be interpreted as ''nothing''. However, subtraction brings the possibility of expressing 0 by other numbers, for example $ {7-7=0} $ and $ {19-19=0} $. In many practical situations, 0 indicates some form of equilibrium, like two equal but opposite forces.

\newpage
\subsection*{Subtraction on the number line: Moving to the left}
In \refsec{Addisjon}, we have seen that \sym{$ + $} (with positive numbers) involves moving  \textsl{to the right} on the number line. With \sym{$ - $} it's the opposite, we move \textsl{to the left}\footnote{In figures with number lines, the red colored arrows indicates that you shall start at the arrowhead and move to the other end.}: \regv

}
\info{Notice}{
	At first it may seem a bit odd moving in the opposite direction of the way in which the arrows point, as in \textsl{Example 1} and \textsl{2}. However, in \refkap{Negtal} this will turn out to be useful.

\subsection*{Multiplication by integers: initial definition }
When adding equal numbers, we can use the multiplication symbol \sym{$ \cdot $}\; to write our calculations more compact: \regv
\eks[]{\vsb \vs
	\alg{
		4+4+4 &= 4\cdot 3 \vn
		8+8 &=8\cdot 2 \vn
		1+1+1+1+1&= 1\cdot5 
	}
} \regv
\spr{
	A calculation involving multiplication includes several \textit{factors}\index{factor} and one \textit{product}\index{product}. In the calculation
	\[ {4\cdot 3=12} \]
	both $ 4 $ and $ 3 $ are factors, while $ 12 $ is the product. \vsk
	
	Common ways of saying $ 4\cdot3 $ include
	\begin{itemize}
		\item ''4 times 3''  \\
		\item ''4 multiplied by 3''
		\item ''4 and 3 multiplied together''
	\end{itemize}
	
	A lot of texts use \sym{$ \times $} instead of \sym{$ \cdot $}. In computer programming, \sym{*} is the most common symbol for multiplication.
}
\subsection*{Multiplication involving amounts}
Let us illustrate $ 2\cdot3 $:
\fig{2t3}
Now notice the product of $ 3\cdot 2 $:
\fig{3t2}
\reg[\gangkom \label{gangkom}]{
	The order of the factors has no impact on the product.

\eks[]{\vsb \vs
	\alg{
		3\cdot 4 &=12= 4\cdot 3 \vn
		6\cdot 7 &=42= 7\cdot6 \vn
		8\cdot 9 &=72= 9\cdot8
	}
}

\subsection*{Multiplication on the number line}
We can also use the number line to calculate multiplications. In the case of $ 2\cdot4 $ we can think like this:
\[\text{''} 2\cdot 4 \text{ means moving 2 places to the right, 4 times.}\text{''} \]
\[ 2\cdot4=8 \]
\fig{2t4l}
We can also use the number line to prove to ourselves that multiplication is commutative:
\[\text{''} 4\cdot 2 \text{ means moving 4 places to the right, 2 times.}\text{''} \]
\[ 4\cdot2=8 \]
\fig{4t2l}


\subsection*{Final definition of multiplication by positive integers}
It may be the most intuitive to interpret ''2 times 3'' as ''3, 2 times''. Then it follows:
\[ \text{''2 times 3''}=3+3 \]
In this section we introduced $ {2\cdot3} $, that is ''2 times 3'', as $ {2+2+2} $. With this interpretation, $ {3+3} $ corresponds to $ {3\cdot2} $, but the fact that multiplication is a commutative operation (\rref{gangkom}) ensures that the one interpretation does not exclude the other; $ {2\cdot3 =2+2+2} $ and $ {2\cdot3=3+3} $ are two expressions of same value.\regv

		8+8 &=8\cdot 2=2+2+2+2+2+2+2 \vn
		1+1+1+1+1&= 1\cdot5 =5
	}
}
\info{Notice}{
	The fact that multiplication with positive integers can be expressed as repeated addition does not exclude other expressions. There's nothing wrong with writing $ {2\cdot 3=1+5} $.

		\item \textbf{The inverse operation of multiplication}\\
		$ 12:3=\text{''The number which yields 12 when multiplied by 3''} $

\spr{ \label{sprakdiv}
	A calculation involving division includes a \textit{dividend}\index{dividend}, a \textit{divisor}\index{divisor} and a \textit{quotient}\index{quotient}.	
	In the calculation
	\[  {12:3=4} \]
	$ 12 $ is the dividend, $ 3 $ is the divisor and $ 4 $ is the quotient.\vsk
	
	Common ways of saying $ 12:3 $ include
	\begin{itemize}
		\item ''12 divided by 3''
		\item ''12 to 3''
	\end{itemize}
	In a lot of contexts, \sym{$ / $} is used instead of \sym{$:$}, especially in computer programming. \vsk
	
	Sometimes $ {12:3} $ is called ''the \textit{ratio}\index{ratio} of 12 to 3''. \vsk
}
\newpage
\subsection*{Distribution of amounts}
The calculation $ {12:3} $ tells that we shall distribute 12 into 3 equal groups:
\fig{del1}
We observe that each group contains 4 boxes, which means that
\[ 12:3=4 \]


\subsection*{Number of equal terms}
\fig{del2}
12 equals the sum of 4 instances of 3, that is $ 12:3=4 $.


\subsection*{The inverse operation of multiplication}
We have just seen that if we divide 12 into 3 equal groups, we get 4 in each group. Hence $ 12:3=4$. The sum of these groups makes 12: 
\fig{del1b}
However, this is the same as multiplying 4 by 3, in other words:
If we know that $ {4\cdot 3=12} $, we also know that $ {12:3=4} $. As well we know that $ {12:4=3} $.
